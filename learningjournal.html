        <p>It’s become easy to drift past pictures and scroll through without really seeing. But the method described in <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a> asks us to stop for a moment and  look again. It’s based on Visual Thinking Strategies (V.T.S.), which ask, “What do you see that makes you say that?” It’s a small question that slows the rush of perception and connects what we notice with what we think. It trains the eye and the mind to move together, offering a more cohesive way of seeing.</p>
        <p>Exploring the <a href="https://www.gfsmith.com/">GF Smith website</a> reminded me how design can invite that kind of attention. The site uses simple clean photographs and partners them with bold color fields and dynamic shapes. Each movement and block of color encourages you to look closer and notice the subtleties of form and tone. I found myself lingering on a single page longer than I expected, curious about why certain shapes moved or how colors interacted.</p>
        <p>The drawback, though, is that this kind of design risks being more style than substance. Not everyone will take the time to engage deeply!</p>
